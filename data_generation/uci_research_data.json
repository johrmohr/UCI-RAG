      "abstract": "Quantum information processing is limited, in practice, to efficiently implementable operations. This motivates the study of quantum divergences that preserve their operational meaning while faithfully capturing these computational constraints. Using geometric, computational, and information theoretic tools, we define two new types of computational divergences, which we term computational max-divergence and computational measured R\\'enyi divergences. Both are constrained by a family of efficient binary measurements, and thus useful for state discrimination tasks in the computational setting. We prove that, in the infinite-order limit, the computational measured R\\'enyi divergence coincides with the computational max-divergence, mirroring the corresponding relation in the unconstrained information-theoretic setting. For the many-copy regime, we introduce regularized versions and establish a one-sided computational Stein bound on achievable hypothesis-testing exponents under efficient measurements, giving the regularized computational measured relative entropy an operational meaning. We further define resource measures induced by our computational divergences and prove an asymptotic continuity bound for the computational measured relative entropy of resource. Focusing on entanglement, we relate our results to previously proposed computational entanglement measures and provide explicit separations from the information-theoretic setting. Together, these results provide a principled, cohesive approach towards state discrimination tasks and resource quantification under computational constraints.",

      "abstract": "Entanglement distillation is a key step in quantum information, both theoretically and practically. It has been proven that non-positive-partial transpose (NPT) entangled states of rank at most four is 1-distillable under local operation and classical communications. In this paper we investigate the distillation of a more complex family of NPT entangled states, namely a family of symmetric two-qutrit states $\\r$ of rank five with given eigenvectors. We explicitly construct five families of such states by requiring four of the five eigenvalues to be the same. We respectively show that some of them are 1-distillable. It turns out that such states may be not 1-distillable for some interval of eigenvalues. We provide some conditions for eigenvalues that allow $\\r$ to be 1-distillable or to be 1-undistillable.",

      "abstract": "Discrete time quasicrystals (DTQC) constitute a class of non-equilibrium matter characterized by temporal order without strict periodicity, in contrast to conventional time crystals. Investigating these phenomena is essential for expanding our fundamental understanding of far-from-equilibrium quantum matter and spontaneous symmetry breaking beyond periodic regimes. Here, we experimentally observe a DTQC in a driven-dissipative ensemble of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms, displaying non-equilibrium dynamical response with a different finite Abelian group symmetry $\\mathbb{Z}{_m} \\times \\mathbb{Z}{_n}$. By applying a quasi-periodic drive using a dual-frequency drive with incommensurate frequencies, we demonstrate that the system exhibits a robust subharmonic response at multiple incommensurate frequencies, signifying the emergence of a DTQC phase. We map the full phase diagram of the system, which includes the DTQC phase, and demonstrated its rigidity against perturbations in both RF field intensity and laser detuning. Moreover, we observe a cyclic group symmetry effect that constrains the construction of $\\mathbb{Z}{_2} \\times \\mathbb{Z}{_3}$-symmetric DTQC. This work establishes a versatile platform for studying non-equilibrium phases of matter and provides insights into the dynamics of time-translation symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems.",

      "abstract": "When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.",

Amplification is known to boost any inverse-polynomial gap between completeness and soundness to exponentially small error, and a recent result (Jeffery and Witteveen, 2025) shows that completeness can in fact be amplified to be doubly exponentially close to 1. We prove that this is optimal for black-box procedures: we provide a quantum oracle relative to which no QMA verification procedure using polynomial resources can achieve completeness closer to 1 than doubly exponential, or a soundness which is super-exponentially small. This is proven by using techniques from complex approximation theory, to make the oracle separation from (Aaronson, 2008), between QMA and QMA with perfect completeness, quantitative.",

      "abstract": "Multicast for securely sharing confidential data among many users is becoming increasingly important. Currently, it relies on duplicate-and-forward routing and cryptographic methods based on computational security. However, these approaches neither attain multicast capacity of the network, nor ensure long-term security against advances in computing (information-theoretic security: ITS). Existing ITS solutions--quantum key distribution (QKD), physical layer security (PLS), and secure network coding (SNC)--still fail to enable scalable networks, as their underlying assumptions, such as trusted nodes and wiretap thresholds, gradually become invalid as the network grows. Here, we develop an efficient multi-tree multicast path-finding method to address this issue, integrating it with universal strongly ramp SNC. This system, path-controlled universal strongly ramp SNC (PUSNEC), can be overlaid onto QKD/PLS networks, enabling multicast capacity, ITS, and scalability. We derive the maximum leakage information to an eavesdropper under the probabilistic wiretap network assumption and demonstrate secure multicast in multi-hop networks through numerical simulations. Our quantitative analysis of the secrecyreliability tradeoff highlights a practical approach to achieving secure, reliable multicast on a global scale.",

In particular, no quantum operation can transform a finite number of copies of an unknown quantum state or channel into a pure state or channel that depends on the input, thereby ruling out an important form of universal purification in both static and dynamical settings. Relaxing the requirement of exact pure output, we further extend our result to establish quantitative sample complexity bounds for approximate purification, independent of any task details or operational constraints. To illustrate the practical consequences of this principle, we examine the task of approximately preparing pure dilation and, for the first time, prove an exponential lower bound on the required sample complexity.",

      "abstract": "Bell inequalities are a cornerstone of quantum physics. By carefully selecting measurement bases (typically polarization), their violation certifies quantum entanglement. Such measurements are disrupted by the presence of optical disorder in propagation paths, including polarization or spatial mode mixing in fibers and through free-space turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that disorder can instead be exploited as a resource to certify entanglement via a Bell inequality test. In our experiment, one photon of a polarization-entangled pair propagates through a commercial multimode fiber that scrambles spatial and polarization modes, producing a speckle pattern, while the other photon remains with the sender. By spatially resolving the speckle intensity pattern, we naturally access a large set of random and unknown polarization projections. We show that this set is statistically sufficient to violate a Bell inequality, thereby certifying entanglement without requiring active correction techniques. Our approach provides a fundamentally new way to test Bell inequalities, eliminating the need for an explicit choice of measurement basis, and offering a practical solution for entanglement certification in real-world quantum communication channels where disorder is unavoidable.",

The sub-Hz end of the spectrum is usually dealt with by repeated background calibrations, which bring considerable overhead. It is thus important to characterize and understand the low-frequency variations of the relevant qubit characteristics. In this study, we investigate the stability of spin qubit frequencies in the Si/SiGe quantum dot platform. We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of a six-qubit device vary by up to $\\pm 100$ MHz while performing a variety of experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept constant to within 15 $\\mathrm{\\mu}$V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than $\\pm 7$ MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise spectral density shows roughly a $1/f$ trend above $10^{-4}$ Hz and, strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.",

In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations of the classical and quantum crossover differ, reflecting the noncommutativity of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement, quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems.",

      "abstract": "Anharmonic potential quantum system play crucial role in physics as they provide a more realistic description of oscillatory phenomena, which often deviate from the idealized harmonic model. However, simulating such system on classical computers is highly challenging due to nonlinear interactions, large state spaces, and the exponential scaling of memory and computational resources. In this work, quantum simulation is employed to model a quantum anharmonic oscillator (QAHO) using a 3-qubit system implemented on IBM's Quantum Experiences platform. A quantum circuit with a filter-based design and Toffoli gates is constructed to track quantum state evolution, capturing key phenomena like quantum revival. The framework is further extended to n-qubit system to enhance resolution and scalability. For energy estimation, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a TwoLocal ansatz and variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), are used to compute ground and excited state energies. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy with an error of only 1.11% compared to exact methods. Notably, VQE outperforms classical approximations such as perturbation theory (error 6.71%) and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation(error 5.36%), yielding more precise energy values. These results highlight the potential of quantum simulation and VQD as effective tools for investigating complex quantum system, paving the way for future application in quantum chemistry and materials science as quantum hardware continues to advance.",

      "abstract": "Employing the principle of quantum teleportation in gravitational-wave detectors provides a method to address technical challenges associated with implementing quantum filters for squeezed-light injection. A recent proposal has shown that an arbitrary number of effective squeezing-angle rotations can be achieved by cascading quantum teleportation, yielding sensitivity equivalent to frequency-dependent pre-filtering. A natural question is whether the teleportation-based protocol can also realize frequency-dependent post-filtering. In this work, we examine this possibility and show that, with perfect teleportation fidelity, post-filtering can be fully implemented. In practice, however, various imperfections make the sensitivity nearly equivalent to that of teleportation-based pre-filtering. We apply this scheme to the low-frequency detector in the Einstein Telescope xylophone configuration and find that teleportation-based post-filtering could also be a candidate for the detector's design.",

      "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\\% for tasks involving up to 40 qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their potential for practical applications.",

      "abstract": "Random classical linear codes are widely believed to be hard to decode. While slightly sub-exponential time algorithms exist when the coding rate vanishes sufficiently rapidly, all known algorithms at constant rate require exponential time. By contrast, the complexity of decoding a random quantum stabilizer code has remained an open question for quite some time. This work closes the gap in our understanding of the algorithmic hardness of decoding random quantum versus random classical codes. We prove that decoding a random stabilizer code with even a single logical qubit is at least as hard as decoding a random classical code at constant rate--the maximally hard regime. This result suggests that the easiest random quantum decoding problem is at least as hard as the hardest random classical decoding problem, and shows that any sub-exponential algorithm decoding a typical stabilizer code, at any rate, would immediately imply a breakthrough in cryptography. More generally, we also characterize many other complexity-theoretic properties of stabilizer codes. While classical decoding admits a random self-reduction, we prove significant barriers for the existence of random self-reductions in the quantum case. This result follows from new bounds on Clifford entropies and Pauli mixing times, which may be of independent interest. As a complementary result, we demonstrate various other self-reductions which are in fact achievable, such as between search and decision. We also demonstrate several ways in which quantum phenomena, such as quantum degeneracy, force several reasonable definitions of stabilizer decoding--all of which are classically identical--to have distinct or non-trivially equivalent complexity.",

      "title": "Quantum Algorithm for Subcellular Multiscale Reaction-Diffusion Systems",
      "abstract": "Computational modeling of cellular systems, where reactants are governed by biochemical equations and physical representations, requires extensive classical computing resources. These limitations significantly constrain the system size and spatiotemporal scales of simulations. A key challenge lies in the \"curse of dimensionality\", where the number of possible reaction terms grows exponentially with the number of species, and the computation of reaction rates involving many-body interactions becomes intractable in polynomial time on classical computers. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithmic framework designed to overcome these challenges, leveraging the architecture of quantum computing to simultaneously compute reaction rates and track the spatiotemporal dynamical evolutions of subcellular systems. We generalize the reaction-diffusion equation (RDE) for multiscale systems with arbitrary species count, encompassing higher-order interactions. Our approach achieves two principal quantum advantages: (i) an exponential quantum speedup in reaction-rate computation, contingent on the efficient preparation of polynomially accurate ground states on a quantum computer, and (ii)) a quadratic scaling in spatial grid points and polynomial scaling in the number of species for solving nonlinear RDEs, contrasting sharply with classical methods that scale exponentially with the system's degrees of freedom. To our knowledge, this represents the first efficient quantum algorithm for solving multiscale reaction-diffusion systems. This framework opens the door to simulations of biologically relevant subcellular processes across previously inaccessible spatial and temporal scales, with profound implications for computational biology, soft matter physics, and biophysical modeling.",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning Hamiltonians from time evolution: given the ability to apply $e^{-iHt}$ for an unknown Hamiltonian on $n$ qubits, the goal is to recover the parameters of $H$. This is a well-studied problem in quantum learning theory, with applications to quantum metrology, sensing, device benchmarking, and many-body physics. For this problem, we demonstrate the first lower bounds which scale with the number of parameters of the unknown Hamiltonian. When the unknown Hamiltonian is arbitrary, we show that learning to error $\\epsilon$ requires $2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \\epsilon$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian is additionally assumed to be $k$-local, we show that learning to constant error requires $n^{\\Omega (k)}$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian, resolving an open question of Tang. These bounds immediately imply that any learning algorithm with inverse polynomial time resolution requires super-polynomial total evolution time. Our lower bounds hold even for very simple planted spike detection problems, where the goal is to detect the presence of a single coefficient which is super-polynomially larger than the other coefficients of the Hamiltonian, as well as for average case instances.",

      "abstract": "Rydberg atom based sensors allow for SI traceable measurements and show promise for applications in the field of communication and radar technologies. In this article, we investigate the bandwidth and sensitivity of a Rydberg atom-based sensor in a rubidium vapor cell using Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy. We employ a radio-frequency (RF) heterodyne measurement technique in combination with an optical homodyne setup to extend the achievable range between sensitivity and bandwidth in a Rydberg sensor. While the bandwidth of Rydberg sensors are limited by the transit time of atoms and the Rabi frequency of the coupling field, achieving higher bandwidth through smaller beam sizes is thought to compromise sensitivity due to reduced EIT signal strength. Using optical homodyne detection, we demonstrate that sensitivity is preserved while achieving a response bandwidth of 8 MHz. In addition, using the Rydberg sensor, we receive digital communication signals and present error vector magnitude (EVM) measurements as a function of varying symbol rates and bandwidth of the Rydberg sensor. Furthermore, the sensor's performance is compared with a conventional RF mixer. We establish that the bandwidth of a Rydberg sensor when receiving a pure tone is not the same as the bandwidth of the sensor when receiving a modulated signal. This difference results from the spreading of symbols in the frequency domain, leading to a reduction of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and an accumulation of noise over the total span of the modulated signal.",

We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts coherence and population dynamics of spin networks across a wide range of parameter regimes, encompassing nuclear spin sensors and qubits in solid-state semiconductors and molecular magnets. Our method further predicts spin dynamics under the influence of repeated light pulses, which are commonly used to mitigate decoherence and perform quantum sensing experiments. Our method thus provides reliable results for moderately-sized spin platforms spanning molecular magnets and solid-state spins that can guide the development of approximate but efficient quantum dynamics methods and enable principled inquiry into decoherence mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are iterative algorithms suited to implementation on current-era quantum devices. VQAs employ classical optimization to minimize cost functions evaluated on quantum circuits. However, the extent to which VQAs manage noise is often insufficient for quantum chemistry applications. One method of improving VQAs is through accurate ansatz initialization. The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the average information scrambling and nonlocal magic generation properties of random Clifford encoding-decoding circuits perturbed by local noise. We quantify these with the bipartite algebraic out-of-time order correlator ($\\mathcal{A}$-OTOC) and average Pauli-entangling power (APEP) respectively. Using recent advances in the representation theory of the Clifford group, we compute both quantities' averages in the limit that the circuits become infinitely large. We observe that both display a ``butterfly effect\" whereby noise occurring on finitely many qubits leads to macroscopic information scrambling and nonlocal magic generating power. Finally, we numerically study the relationship between the magic capacity, an operator-level magic monotone, of the noise channel and the APEP of the resulting circuit, which may provide insight for designing efficient nonlocal magic factories.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we explore (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED) at finite density on a quantum computer, including two fermion flavors. Our method employs an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit structure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our simulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification of phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors. Classical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters, which are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude by discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to larger systems.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates quantum dots (QDs), which are miniature semiconductor structures with remarkable optical and electrical properties due to quantum confinement processes. Traditional QDs, such as CdTe, have been extensively investigated; however, they frequently exhibit toxicity and stability issues. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are emerging as a safer and more stable alternative to traditional QDs. GQDs are honeycomb-lattice carbon atoms with unique electronic and optical properties that make them promising candidates for biomedical, electronic, and energy storage applications. GQD synthesis methods (top-down and bottom-up) and their advantages over standard QDs include better photostability, biocompatibility, and configurable band gaps. GQDs are perfect for real-world uses like sensitive biosensing, real-time food safety monitoring, and smart packaging because of their low toxicity, high sensitivity, and affordability. These uses are all essential for cutting down on food grain waste. This emphasizes the growing significance of GQDs in advancing nanotechnology and their potential integration with quantum technologies, paving the door for creative solutions in biosensing, food safety, environmental monitoring, and future quantum electronics.",

By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.",

However, the intensive amplification transfers individual discrete quanta to a detected continuous signal, so Fock probabilities of the unknown input state are not readily available. To solve this issue, we directly derive and analyze a quantum non-Gaussianity witness based on the photon number mean and variance (or alternatively, the second-order correlation $g^{(2)}$) of the unknown state, which can be inferred from post-amplification integrated intensity moments. Since this new witness is based on first and second moments only, measurement results are easy to correct for losses and additive noise.",

Using techniques from defect CFT, we show that correlation functions of these defect operators factorize into two sectors: a universal generalized free-field sector, and a chiral current sector analogous to edge modes in Chern-Simons theory. In a similar setup, we also revisit the twist fields attached to non-invertible line defects in the 2d compact boson CFT. We discuss a defect 't Hooft anomaly involving a chiral $O(2)$ symmetry, highlighting its dynamical implications.",

      "abstract": "String field theory is supposed to stand to perturbative string theory as quantum field theory stands to single-particle quantum theory; as such, it purports to offer a substantially more general and powerful perspective on string theory than the perturbative approach. In addition, string field theory has been claimed for several decades to liberate string theory from any fixed, background spatiotemporal commitments -- thereby (if true) rendering it `background independent'. But is this really so? In this article, we undertake a detailed interrogation of this claim, finding that the verdict is sensitive both to one's understanding of the notion of background independence, and also to how one understands string field theory itself. Although in the end our verdicts on the question of the background independence are therefore somewhat mixed, we hope that our study will elevate the levels of systematicity and rigour in these discussions, as well as equip philosophers of physics with a helpful introduction to string field theory and the variety of interesting conceptual questions which it raises.",

      "abstract": "The thermodynamics of black holes provides a profound link between gravity, quantum theory and statistical mechanics. It serves as a useful tool for testing theories beyond Einstein's gravity. In this work of ours, we investigate the newly found restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST) of charged static and charged rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity. Unlike the extended phase space (EPST) approach, RPST keeps the cosmological constant fixed and introduces the central charge $C$ along with its conjugate chemical potential $\\mu$, thereby allowing the black hole mass to be consistently interpreted as internal energy. Within this framework, we derive the relevant thermodynamic quantities and analyse the temperature-entropy $(T-S)$ and Helmholtz free energy-temperature $(F-T)$ behaviours. Our results reveal characteristic features of first-order phase transitions through non-monotonic $T-S$ curves along with the swallow-tail structures in $F-T$ plots, while second-order transitions appear at critical points. To further validate these findings, we employ the formalism of geometrothermodynamics (GTD), which provides a Legendre-invariant geometric description of thermodynamic geometry. We demonstrate that the curvature singularities of the GTD scalar curvature coincides exactly with that of the divergences in the specific heat capacity curves, thereby establishing a geometric correspondence for phase transitions. This study facilitates the first systematic exploration of RPST within $f(R)$ gravity and highlights the universality of RPST in capturing black hole criticality in modified gravity theories.",

Then, the descending Lie algebra of those groups are necessary real. In most cases, the complexification of those Lie algebra is necessary in order to derive irreductible representations of the Lie algebra and subsequently of the symmetry group. In this paper, we give a precise definition of the concept and prove step by step an important result $$\\left(\\mathfrak{g}^\\mathbb{R}\\right)_\\mathbb{C} \\simeq \\mathfrak{g} \\times \\bar{\\mathfrak{g}}. $$ This result is used to determine the irreductible representations of the proper Lorentz group and thus the physical objects admissible when this symmetry is present. It is shown that finite representations of the proper Lorentz group are characterized by pairs of half-integers $(j_1,j_2)$, which determine unambiguously the physical object associated to the given representation. For example, the representation $(0,0)$ of dimension $1$ is called the scalar representation, it corresponds to the Higgs field, and $(\\frac{1}{2},0) \\oplus (0,\\frac{1}{2})$ of dimension $4$ is called the Dirac spinor representation, it corresponds to matter particle called fermions.

      "title": "Holographic Brownian dynamics of a heavy particle in a boosted thermal plasma background",
      "abstract": "In this work, we have performed a detailed holographic analysis of the stochastic dynamics of a heavy quark propagating through a strongly coupled plasma moving with a constant velocity along a fixed spatial direction. To model this scenario within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider a boosted AdS black brane geometry in the bulk. The boost corresponds to the uniform motion of the plasma on the boundary field theory side. The presence of this boost introduces a preferred direction, leading to an anisotropic environment in which the behavior of the quark differs depending on its direction of motion. Consequently, we examine two distinct cases, namely, quark motion parallel to the direction of the boost and motion perpendicular to it. In this work we have computed the diffusion coefficient for both along the boost and perpendicular to the boost directions. We have obtained the diffusion coefficient by following the two different approaches in both the cases. These complementary approaches yield consistent results, thereby reinforcing the reliability of the computations carried out. Additionally, we derive and verify the fluctuation-dissipation relation within this anisotropic setup, confirming its validity in both longitudinal and transverse channels. Our findings provide deeper insight into the non-equilibrium transport properties of strongly coupled plasma and further elucidate the holographic description of Brownian motion in anisotropic backgrounds. Then we have moved on to proving the fluctuation dissipation theorem in this context. Finally, we proceed to holographcally compute the Butterfly velocity by using the entanglement wedge subregion duality and express the diffusion coefficients in terms of the chaotic observables.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a bi-graded polynomial that encodes the cohomology groups of the wild Hitchin system of type~$A_{n-1}$, constructed using an irregular singularity (determined by an integer~$m$) and an arbitrary regular singularity~$f$. When the regular singularity is of the form~$f = [1, \\ldots, 1]$, the bi-graded polynomial~$C_{m,n}(q,t)$ coincides with the bigraded rational parking function defined combinatorially, admitting a Schur expansion~$C_{m,n}(q,t) = \\sum_\\lambda f_\\lambda(q,t) s_\\lambda(x)$. For general~$f$, the polynomial takes the form~$C^f_{m,n}(q,t) = \\sum_\\lambda f_\\lambda(q,t) K_{\\lambda f}$, where~$K_{\\lambda f}$ denotes the Kostka number.

      "abstract": "We investigate a baryonic structure in low-energy QCD via a model-independent way using the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, in the presence of the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$, the isospin chemical potential $\\mu_I$, and the electromagnetic coupling. For such a scenario in the chiral limit, it has been known that the neutral pion winds like in the chiral soliton lattice, confined within an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex of the charged pions. This structure undergoes a drastic transformation when the pion mass is introduced, i.e., both charged and neutral pions condense in the bulk, allowing two distinct types of vortices: the charged pions constitute a local ANO-like vortex, while the neutral pion configures a global vortex which is further attached to a domain wall also known as the chiral soliton. Remarkably, the ANO vortex forms a topological linking with the closed global vortex line, when $\\mu_B$ exceeds its critical value as a function of $\\mu_I$. The linking number has the physical meaning of the baryon number in view of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In this sense, the linked configuration realizes a stable Skyrmion-type solution, but innovatively without the Skyrme term. We therefore propose a novel phase of dense baryonic matter comprised of such vortices, which shall play a role in the low-energy QCD phase diagram.",

Here we show that a non-commutative five-dimensional Chern-Simons theory living on the projective spinor bundle of three-dimensional space-time compactifies to a Lagrangian formulation of the KP equation. Essential to the definition of the theory is a 2-form pulled back from minitwistor space. The dispersionless limit of the KP equation is similarly described by Poisson-Chern-Simons theory. We further show that, consistent with integrability, all tree level amplitudes vanish. The universal vertex algebra living on a two-dimensional surface defect in $5d$ is $W_{1+\\infty}$, and its operator products coincide with collinear splitting functions on space-time. Taking the dispersionless limit contracts the vertex algebra to $w_{1+\\infty}$.",

In this paper, we consider theories with non-invertible symmetries that have an explicit Lagrangian description, and use it to study their higher structure. Starting with the 2d free compact boson theory and its non-invertible duality defects, we will find Lagrangian descriptions of networks of defects and use them to recover all the $F$-symbols of the familiar Tambara-Yamagami fusion category $\\operatorname{TY}(\\mathbb{Z}_N,+1)$. We will then use the same approach in 4d Maxwell theory to compute $F$-symbols associated with its non-invertible duality and triality defects, which are 2d topological field theories. In addition, we will also compute some of the $F$-symbols using a different (group theoretical) approach that is not based on the Lagrangian description, and find that they take the expected form.",

Moreover, it accommodates arbitrary boundary conditions for bulk fields, moving beyond the standard Dirichlet prescription. As part of this development, we construct a one-parameter family of renormalized boundary conditions that, unlike conventional choices in the literature, lead to a finite on-shell action.

D \\textbf{111} (2025) no.10, 103512] that regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) form stable, zero-temperature remnants and could thereby constitute dark matter is critically examined. While the introduction of a fundamental length scale indeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show that the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds generically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic and quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true remnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating objects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a cosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting radiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds. Therefore, low-mass RPBHs are not viable dark matter candidates.",

We show that for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may exist.",

      "abstract": "On-shell amplitudes are invariant under field redefinitions. Nonderivative field redefinitions have a natural interpretation as coordinate transformations on the target manifold. General field redefinitions, which may involve derivatives, can be viewed as coordinate transformations on the field configuration manifold. We present a unified perspective for the geometry of both the target manifold and the field configuration manifold for scalar effective field theories. In both cases, we identify vertices that can be used to build the tree-level amplitudes, with the property that they transform covariantly in the vacuum and on-shell limits. We identify a choice of metric on the field configuration manifold, for which amplitude expressions on the target manifold can be easily reproduced from their counterparts on the field configuration manifold. This clarifies the relation between the well-established framework of field space geometry and recent proposals for functional geometry.",

      "abstract": "Spectral statistics of quantum chaotic systems are governed by random matrix universality. In many cases of interest, time-reversal symmetry selects the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as the relevant universality class. In holographic CFTs, this is mirrored by the presence of non-orientable geometries in the dual gravitational path integral. In this work, we analyze general properties of these matrix models and their gravitational counterparts. First, we develop a formalism to express the universal level statistics in the canonical ensemble for arbitrary spectral curves, leading to a topological expansion with finite radius of convergence in the late-time $\\tau$-scaling limit. Then, we focus on topological gravity and study topological recursion on the moduli space of non-orientable surfaces. We find that the Weil-Petersson volumes display non-analytic behaviour multiplying polynomials in the boundary lengths. The volumes give rise to wormholes with late-time divergences, in contrast with the orientable case, which is finite. We identify systematic cancellations among WP volumes implied by the consistency and finiteness of the $\\tau$-scaling limit. In particular, the cancellation of late-time divergences requires a nontrivial genus resummation. Working in the gravitational microcanonical ensemble, we derive and resum all orders of the topological expansion matching the GOE matrix model in the high-energy regime.",

We give strong evidence for this claim by showing that the $\\beta$-function for this coupling vanishes to 2-loop order if and only if this symmetry is present.

      "abstract": "Perturbations in the cosmic neutrino background produce a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), providing a unique observational probe of neutrino physics. In this work, we explore how this phase shift signature is altered in the presence of neutrino interactions with temperature-dependent scattering rates, motivated by physical constructions for neutrino self-interactions and neutrino-dark matter couplings. A key finding is that the phase shift in these realistic models -- characterized by gradual rather than instantaneous decoupling -- maintains the same functional form as the free-streaming template, with only the asymptotic amplitude decreasing for stronger interactions that delay decoupling. This simple parametrization enables us to directly constrain neutrino interactions through phase shift measurements in the temperature and polarization power spectra from CMB observations. Analyzing the latest data from \\textit{Planck}, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, we derive strong constraints on the neutrino decoupling redshift. Our global analysis indicates that neutrinos have been freely streaming since deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. We also explore flavor-dependent scenarios in which only one neutrino species interacts. Overall, our work establishes a signature-driven framework that exploits the clean phase shift signal in the acoustic oscillations of the CMB as a precise and robust probe of non-standard neutrino interactions in the early universe.",

For each model, the parameter space consistent with all elemental $Z$-constraints and the freeze-out condition is determined.

The resulting asymptotic series, once completed with non-perturbative terms, allowed the leading resurgence relations to be tested. In this Letter we focus directly on the determinants themselves, and we uncover a strikingly simple non-perturbative structure: all trans-series corrections share a universal form, while the moments transform in a direct and intuitive way.

Our method preserves the factorization between \"fast\" and \"slow\" modes in the longitudinal momentum $k^+$ for a projectile moving along the positive light-cone direction, making it compatible with higher-order loop computations done within the standard formulation of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. Moreover, it eliminates the anomalous double collinear logarithms that typically hinder the convergence of perturbation theory at small-$x$. Our scheme amounts to a change of basis in the space of CGC operators, introducing an arbitrary transverse scale dependence while leaving physical cross-sections invariant. Implementing this scheme requires a modification of the high-energy renormalization group equation for the CGC operators, which we explicitly derive at next-to-leading order (NLO) and in the non-linear regime for the case of the dipole operator and the DIS impact factor. This general framework provides a consistent and systematic prescription for computing observables in the small-$x$ regime of QCD, free from collinear instabilities.",

To render the problem well-posed at the puncture, we impose boundary conditions at the excised point, which we take to be of Robin type. This setup yields a discrete sector, given by bound-state solutions of the radial equation with real, positive frequencies, which characterizes the detector. We construct the full two-point function and show its decomposition into: (i) the discrete radial bound-state sector, (ii) the boundary condition modified continuous sector, and (iii) the unmodified Dirichlet sector. We then compute the detector field's stress-energy tensor and prove its covariant conservation. For the specific localized modes in this setup, the discrete-sector contribution cancels in the complete stress-energy tensor, leaving only boundary-condition induced terms. Notably, the discrete modes crucial to localized field-based detectors emerge naturally from the boundary conditions, without ad hoc confining potentials, providing a fully relativistic framework that extends the traditional Unruh-DeWitt paradigm. This mechanism is not restricted to Minkowski spacetime: the same construction can be applied to massive fields on backgrounds with naked singularities, such as conical and global monopole spacetimes, offering a unified route to detector localization in a broad class of geometries.",

The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.",

      "abstract": "One of the key features of the $R^2$-gravity is the embedding of a scalar field, scalaron, into the gravity sector. The scalaron interacts with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields through Planck-suppressed couplings. If the scalaron serves as a viable dark matter (DM) candidate, it can account for the lack of evidence of DM interactions beyond gravity in experimental and observational probes to date. The realization of the scalaron, as a cold DM candidate, depends on an induced trilinear interaction with the SM Higgs, despite its suppressed coupling strength. Here, we introduce a Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity that additionally contributes to the induced trilinear interaction with its existing competing part, originated from the $R^2$-gravity. We study the interplay between these two contributions in the early universe, which determines both the initial conditions and evolution of the scalaron, leading to cold DM behavior at a later epoch. The trilinear interaction vanish identically for certain combinations of the Higgs non-minimal coupling and the scalaron mass, thereby setting the scalaron density through misalignment mechanism, similar to axions. Consequently, we find that the observed DM relic density is obtained for a scalaron mass between $1.38$ keV and $0.7$ MeV. The lower limit on the mass stems from the LHC constraints on the Higgs non-minimal coupling, whereas the upper bound arises from INTEGRAL/SPI limits on the excess gamma-ray flux from possible scalaron decays to two photons.",

      "abstract": "By interpreting the difference between the original Regge-Wheeler potential and its piecewise step approximation as perturbative effects induced by the external environment of the black hole, we investigate the stability of Schwarzschild black hole time-domain waveforms. In this work, we employ the Green's function method under the assumption of an observer at spatial infinity to obtain the waveform. For two cases in which the initial Gaussian bump near the event horizon or at spatial infinity, we derive analytic expressions for the corresponding waveforms. Our results demonstrate that the waveform is indeed insensitive to tiny modifications of the effective potential, thereby confirming its stability. More importantly, we find that broader initial bumps imprint the influence of small environmental modifications more clearly on the waveform, which may provide theoretical guidance for probing the exterior environment of black holes.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a comprehensive investigation of a novel cosmological model that unifies the Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) equation of state with gravitationally induced matter creation and bulk viscous dissipation in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The MCG fluid is characterized by an exotic equation of state $p = A\\rho - C/\\rho^\\alpha$, while the matter creation rate is taken as $\\Gamma = 3\\beta H$ and the bulk viscous pressure as $\\pi = -3H\\xi_0 \\rho_m^{1/2}$. We derive the modified Friedmann equations and obtain an analytical expression for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, which is then used to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of key cosmological parameters: the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, jerk parameter $j(z)$, and snap parameter $s(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using two observational datasets: DS1 (Pantheon+ + Cosmic Chronometers + DESI BAO + $\\sigma_8$) and DS2 (DS1 + R22), employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The results indicate that the proposed hybrid model successfully generates a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion, consistent with current observations. Notably, the inclusion of R22 data leads to a higher best-fit value of $H_0$, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we perform a rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the model by testing the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics. We compute the total entropy rate of change $\\dot{S}_{\\text{total}} = \\dot{S}_{\\text{fluid}} + \\dot{S}_{\\text{horizon}}$, finding it positive throughout cosmic history for both datasets, confirming the model's thermodynamic viability. The second derivative $\\ddot{S}_{\\text{total}}$ exhibits a clear transition from positive to negative values around $z \\sim 1$, indicating a shift from accelerating to decelerating entropy production a signature of late-time thermodynamic stabilization.",

In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.",

      "abstract": "We present a passive ultraviolet charge management system for the fused silica test masses in ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The system uses photoelectron emission from low work-function gold coatings illuminated by 275 to 285 nm UV light to neutralize unwanted electric charges on the electrically floating test masses, maintaining them at zero potential relative to surrounding components. Two implementation schemes are described: 1. distributed discharge tabs illuminated by UV LEDs mounted at the eight surrounding earthquake stops, and 2. a conductively linked tab design enabling a centralized discharge on the test mass barrel, with potential extension to annular coatings around the high-reflectivity and anti-reflective surfaces. Experimental results show photoelectric currents greater or equal to 10 pA for 1.0 mW of incident UV, enabling discharge rates greater than 10V/s for a 1 pF capacitance. With 0.2 mW UV power, charge neutralization to less or equal to 1 pC can be achieved in 5 to 75 minutes. This technique offers a vacuum-compatible alternative to ion sprayers, significantly reducing operational downtime. For the conductive-barrel configuration, we also propose a balanced electrostatic actuator using four parallel-plate capacitors for combined control of TM axial displacement, tilt, and azimuth, with reduced drive voltages.",

For k-essence, in order a perturbative Kerr--Schild type solution to become exact, the k-essence Lagrangian was either linear in the kinetic term (with the Kerr--Schild congruence autoparallel) or unrestricted, provided the scalar gradient along the congruence vanishes. A similar reasoning for the pure kinetic braiding contribution leads to either a vanishing Lagrangian or a scalar which is constant along the congruence. From the scalar dynamics we also derive an accompanying constraint. Finally, we discuss pp-waves, an example of Kerr--Schild spacetime generated by a constant k-essence along the Kerr--Schild congruence with vanishing Lagrangian. This allows for the construction of a Fock-type space, consisting of a tower of Kerr--Schild maps first yielding a vacuum pp-wave from flat spacetime; next a k-essence generated pp-wave from the vacuum pp-wave; and finally an arbitrary number of k-essence pp-waves with different, retarded time dependent metric functions.",

      "abstract": "Newtonian and post-Newtonian (PN) calculations indicate that the phenomenology of eccentric binary black hole (BBH) merger waveforms is significantly more complex than that of their quasi-circular counterparts. Each spherical harmonic mode of the radiation can be further decomposed into several eccentricity-induced components, referred to as eccentric harmonics. Unlike the (cumulative) spherical harmonic modes, these constituent eccentric harmonics exhibit monotonically time-varying amplitudes and frequencies. However, these eccentric harmonics are not directly accessible in numerical relativity (NR) simulations or current eccentric waveform models. Using the recently developed data-driven framework gwMiner, which combines singular value decomposition, input from post-Newtonian theory, and signal processing techniques, we extract eccentric harmonics from eccentric, aligned-spin waveforms for six different spherical harmonic modes: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). We demonstrate that the phase (frequency) of each eccentric harmonic takes the form $j\\,\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\lambda} + \\phi_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$ ($j\\,f_{\\ell,m,\\lambda} + f_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$), where $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}$ ($f_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}$) corresponds to the secular orbital phase (frequency), and $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$ ($f_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$) is an additional contribution that depends solely on the eccentricity. We further find that $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}$ is the same across different spherical harmonic modes $(\\ell, m)$, whereas the eccentric correction term $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$ scales with $\\ell$. Using effective-one-body dynamics, we further show that $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}$ is nothing but the relativistic anomaly and $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$ is related to the precession advances.",

We then apply this formalism to analyze the evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$ Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object. Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a supermassive black hole.",

In this work, we study the properties of two models for ultra-compact objects containing light rings - relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. We have simulated the orbit of a hot spot around the considered objects in the polarization ray-tracing software GYOTO, and extracted observables, namely integrated images of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U; their evolution during the orbit in the QU-plane, and the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Our models resemble the black hole qualitatively, with slight additional imprints which provide a useful tool to constrain the spacetime metric of supermassive compact objects with current and future observations, and probe the fundamental properties of these objects. We have found that one fluid star model with a pressure singularity resembles the black hole entirely, while another gravastar features notable differences in the EVPA curve in the low-inclination case. Since differences between the models become more pronounced for a higher inclination, our results could potentially restrict the adequateness of ECO classes with future high-inclination observations.",

Starting from a general line element with arbitrary redshift and shape functions, we derive the radial Klein-Gordon equation in Schr\\\"odinger form, disentangling the effects of gravitational redshift, spatial curvature, and angular momentum. The dynamics reduce to a generalized Helmholtz equation with a space- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index that encodes throat geometry, halo curvature, and centrifugal contributions. In the asymptotic limit $r \\to \\infty$, the refractive index approaches unity, consistently recovering free-space propagation. Application to representative halo profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White model, the Thomas-Fermi Bose-Einstein condensate, and the Pseudo-Isothermal distribution, combined with zero, Teo-type, and cored redshift functions, reveals evanescent domains, quasi-bound states, and suppression of high-angular-momentum modes near the throat. High-frequency waves converge to the geometric-optics regime, whereas low-frequency modes undergo strong curvature-induced localization. This formalism establishes a non-perturbative link between wormhole geometry, halo structure, and redshift effects, providing a robust framework for scalar-wave phenomenology in astrophysical contexts.",

The necessity of boundary conditions was established by Kay and Studer in the early 1990s, but the consequences of their arbitrariness, represented here by a parameter $q$, for renormalized observables have not been examined. While for $M=0$ stability is achieved only under Dirichlet boundary conditions, for $M>q$ the field is stable and a localized mode emerges. This mode admits a natural interpretation as a covariant model of an extended particle detector, which allows us to investigate how such detectors modify the local vacuum structure. In this framework, the renormalized stress-energy tensor offers a natural way to quantify the influence of the detector on the surrounding spacetime.",

      "abstract": "The Taiji mission for space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection employs laser interferometry to measure picometer-scale distance variations induced by GWs. The tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise in the inter-spacecraft interferometers, which originates from the angular jitters of the spacecrafts and the movable optical subassemblies, is predicted to be one of the main noise sources that might reduce Taiji's sensitivity to GWs. Since these angular jitters can be read out through the differential wavefront sensors, it is possible to suppress TTL noise during the data processing stage by fitting and subtracting it. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for TTL noise suppression, which addresses the issue of unknown noise floor required for optimal estimation in the practical detection scenario, and the design of this algorithm takes into account the presence of GW signals. The algorithm is validated via numerical simulation, which is built on a spacecraft dynamics simulation incorporating Taiji's drag-free and attitude control system. We also demonstrate the robustness of this algorithm by varying TTL coefficients at different levels, indicating that our algorithm is applicable to a range of payload statuses, and ultimately providing a critical advancement toward realizing Taiji's full sensitivity.",

This theory departs from Einstein's general relativity (GR) through the introduction of a scalar gravitational susceptibility function $S(x)$, $1+S > 0$, which is a new feature of the spacetime that vanishes in the GR limit. It is shown that the Schwarzschild spacetime constitutes an exact solution of the modified source-free gravitational field equations provided $S$ is a constant. The mass of the corresponding Schwarzschild solution is given by $M/(1+S)$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the solution in the GR limit.

      "abstract": "We perform a comprehensive cosmographic analysis of Friedmann cosmologies modified by non-extensive entropy frameworks, focusing on Tsallis, R\\'enyi, and Kaniadakis entropies within a novel modified energy-momentum tensor approach. In our approach the microscopic matter density remains $\\rho=m~n$ while the horizon thermodynamics of non-extensive entropy modifies the effective source that drives expansion, $\\rho_{eff}=f(\\rho)\\rho$ which reduces to the standard case for $f(\\rho)=1$. By deriving the generalized Friedmann equations for each entropy type, we calculate analytical expressions for key cosmographic parameters, including the deceleration ($q_0$), jerk ($j_0$), snap ($s_0$), and lerk ($l_0$) parameters, and examine their behavior compared to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model. Our results reveal significant differences between the traditional formal approach and the modified energy-momentum approach, particularly in the Tsallis model where cosmographic parameters and the dimensionless Hubble function $E(z)$ show notable deviations for deformation parameters away from unity. Moreover, both R\\'enyi and Kaniadakis models exhibit increasing tension with $\\Lambda$CDM at higher redshifts, while remaining similar at low redshifts. Importantly, given the persistent $\\sim5\\sigma$ Hubble tension between local and global measurements, our analysis indicates that the flexibility of the modified entropic cosmology framework to alter the expansion rate could potentially alleviate this discrepancy by modifying the effective expansion history in a way compatible with observations. Future work will involve full Bayesian analyses with Pantheon+, DESI, and Planck data to further assess the viability of these models in resolving current cosmological tensions.",

Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\\%} = 29.97 \\pm 0.24\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\\%} = 18.63 \\pm 0.24\\,\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \\pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.",

In this work, we present a model that captures these interactions through a framework inspired by statistical mechanics. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we explore the equilibrium and dynamical properties of a population of cells arranged in a two-dimensional lattice, where each cell is characterized by fluxes of three reactions: glucose consumption ($g$), respiration ($r$), and waste production/absorption ($w$). The system minimizes an energy function influenced by competitive ($J_g > 0$) and cooperative ($J_w < 0$) couplings between cells. Our results reveal three distinct phases: a competitive phase dominated by glucose competition, a cooperative phase marked by ordered waste exchange, and a disordered phase with local-scale cooperation. By incorporating evolutionary dynamics, we demonstrate how initially non-interacting cells can develop effective metabolic interactions, leading to heterogeneous cultures sustained by cross-feeding. These findings are further supported by analytical solutions derived using mean-field approximations. The model provides insights into how environmental constraints and stochastic fluctuations shape community structures, offering a versatile approach to study several emergent phenomena in biological systems.",

However, even when these trajectories are decanalized by an environmental perturbation outside of the range of conditions to which they are robust, they often produce phenotypes similar to known mutants called phenocopies. This correspondence between the effect of environmental and genetic perturbations has received little theoretical attention. Here, we study an abstract regulatory model which is evolved to follow a specific trajectory. We then study the effect of both small and large perturbations to the trajectory both by changing parameters and by perturbing the state in a timed manner. We find, surprisingly, that the phenomenon of phenocopying emerges in evolved trajectories even though the alternative trajectories are not selected for. Our results suggest that evolution simplifies the structure of high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes which can simultaneously show robustness and phenocopying.",

To elucidate this case, we study a single liquid bridge with continuous chemical turnover. These reactions control the bridge radius and lead to purely repulsive forces-contrasting with the typically attractive forces in passive systems. Our results reveal how chemical activity can fundamentally alter forces generated by liquid bridges, which could be exploited by cells.",

      "abstract": "Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Integrative biomolecular modeling of RNA relies on structural refined collections and accurate experimental data that reflect binding and folding behavior. However, the prediction of such collections remains challenging due to the rugged energy landscape and extensive conformational heterogeneity of large RNAs. To overcome these limitations, we applied a FRET-guided strategy to identify RNA conformational states consistent with single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments. We predicted 3D structures of a ribosomal RNA tertiary contact comprising a GAAA tetraloop and a kissing loop using three popular RNA 3D modeling tools namely RNAComposer, FARFAR2, and AlphaFold3, yielding a collection of candidate conformations. These models were structurally validated based on Watson-Crick base-pairing patterns and filtered using an eRMSD threshold. For each retained structure, we computed the accessible contact volume (ACV) of the sCy3/sCy5 dye pair using FRETraj to predict FRET distributions. These distributions were then compared and weighted against experimental smFRET data to identify conformational states compatible with the observed FRET states. Our results demonstrate that experimental transfer efficiencies can be reproduced using \\textit{in silico} predicted RNA 3D structures. This FRET-guided workflow, combined with structural validation, lays the foundation for capturing the highly diverse conformational states characteristic of flexible RNA motifs.",

      "abstract": "Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.",

      "abstract": "To ensure faithful information transmission, cells utilize nonequilibrium drives to reduce errors. Kinetic proofreading is a classic mechanism known to sharpen ligand discrimination by T lymphocytes. It remains an open question whether the adaptive immune system relies solely on kinetic proofreading to boost fidelity. Here, we suggest an alternative: an enhanced form of mechanical proofreading (MPR) in which adaptive force exertion via dynamic cell-cell contact allows faithful selection of high-affinity B lymphocytes. Using a minimal model validated with experiment, we show that adaptive MPR, characterized by mechanical feedback between force generation and contact formation, enables robust discrimination of receptor quality regardless of ligand quantity. Although MPR generically balances the tradeoffs between speed and fidelity, a negative scaling of contact duration with ligand abundance indicates the presence of feedback. Due to its ability to modulate interactions of distinct ligands that share load at membrane contacts, adaptive MPR can be harnessed to mitigate autoimmunity or enhance multivalent vaccines. Overall, this work suggests a generalization of the proofreading mechanism to encompass cellular designs that act across scales to enable competing functionalities.",

      "abstract": "Clinically, palpation is one of the important diagnostic methods to assess tumor malignancy. In laboratory research, it is well accepted that the bulk stiffness of the tumor and the surrounding tissue is closely correlated with the malignant state of the tumor. Here, we postulate that, in addition to tumor stiffness, tumor viscoelasticity - the fact that tumor tissue takes time to bounce back after compression, can also be used to evaluate the tumor malignancy state. In this work, we characterized the viscoelastic properties of breast tumor spheroids using a recently developed microfluidic compression device and a theoretical power law model. Breast tumor cells at varying malignant levels; a non-tumorigenic epithelial (MCF10A), moderately malignant tumor (MCF7) and triple negative metastatic tumor (MDA-MB-231) cells were used. Spheroids embedded within a 3D extracellular matrix were periodically compressed, and their strain responses were recorded using microscopic imaging. Our results revealed that the measured strain relaxation curves can be successfully described by a modified power law model, demonstrated that non-tumorigenic tumor spheroids were more elastic, exhibited shorter relaxation time and less plasticity than those of tumorigenic spheroids. Together, these results highlight that viscoelastic properties in addition to bulk stiffness of the tumor spheroids can serve as a complementary mechanical biomarker of tumor malignancy and demonstrate the validity of a modified power law model for the mechanical characterization of a living tissue.",

      "abstract": "Navigation through narrow passages during colony relocation by the tandem-running ants, $\\textit{Diacamma}$ $\\textit{indicum}$, is a tour de force of biological traffic coordination. Even on one-lane paths, the ants tactfully manage a bidirectional flow: Informed individuals (termed leaders) guide nest-mates (termed followers) from a suboptimal nest to a new optimal nest, and then return to recruit additional followers. We propose that encounters between the ants moving in opposite directions can be modelled within the framework of game theory leading to an understanding of the mechanism behind observed behaviours. Our experiments reveal that, upon encountering a tandem pair (a leader and its follower) on a narrow path, the returning leader reverses her direction and proceeds toward the new nest again as if she becomes the leader guiding a follower. This observed behaviour is consistent with game-theoretic predictions, provided the assumption of perfect rationality is relaxed in favour of bounded rationality -- specifically, procedural rationality. In other words, the experimental outcomes are consistent with sampling equilibrium but not with Nash equilibrium. Our work, which strives to induct the essence of behavioural game theory into the world of ants, is first ever report of realizing sampling equilibrium in scenarios not involving human players.",

      "abstract": "With the completion of development and wound repair, as the epithelium approaches homeostasis, cell proliferation is reduced to a minimum. In parallel, cellular motion transitions from a migratory unjammed state to a quiescent jammed state. This quiescent state is commonly regarded as devoid of large-scale regional variations in cell-cycle re-entry and cellular mechanics. To the contrary, here we report that during late maturation there arises a heretofore unanticipated epithelial reticulum that is supracellular and spans multiple scales of length. This reticulum evolves dynamically and comprises two interpenetrating networks: large regions of cycling and mechanically tensed cells, embedded with islands of non-cycling and mechanically compressed cells. The islands of compressed cells emerge and grow in cell numbers, with gradual jamming and with reduced cellular rearrangements. We show how island growth is both reversible, by provoking unjamming, and detainable, by cell cycle arrest treatment. Moreover, the distribution of island sizes was found to conform to a power-law, thus leading us to employ a computational model of percolating critical networks. Together, the observations indicate that the newly discovered epithelial reticulum self-organizes close to but just shy of criticality - thus avoiding mergers of compressed cell islands. This quasi-criticality reframes epithelial homeostasis as a dynamic regional balance of forces and proliferation.",

We further characterise the nonlinear evolution of these instabilities, deriving exact and approximate solutions for the spreading and mutual attraction of puller clusters, as well as the wavelength coarsening of the helical instability. Our theoretical predictions closely match the experimentally observed wavelengths, timescales, and flow fields in suspensions of photophobic algae, as well as results from direct numerical simulations. These findings reveal the intrinsic instability mechanisms of aligned active suspensions and demonstrate that coherent structures can be destabilised by the flows they generate.",

      "abstract": "Suspensions of swimming bacteria interact hydrodynamically over long ranges, organizing themselves into collective states that drive large-scale chaotic flows, often referred to as \"bacterial turbulence\". Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work, it remains unclear whether an intrinsic length scale underlies the observed patterns. To shed light on the mechanism driving active turbulence, we investigate the emergence of large-scale flows in E. coli suspensions confined within cylindrical chambers, systematically varying confinement height over more than two orders of magnitude. We first demonstrate that the critical density for the onset of collective motion scales inversely with this confinement height without saturation, even for the smallest densities observed. Near the onset, both the observed length and time scales increase sharply, with the length scale bounded only by the vertical confinement. Importantly, both scales exhibit clear power-law dependence on the confinement height, demonstrating the absence of an intrinsic length scale in bacterial collective motion. This holds up to scales nearly 10,000 times the size of a single bacterium, as evidenced by transient coherent vortices spanning the full chamber width near the onset. Our experimental results demonstrating that bacterial turbulence is scale-free provide important constraints for theories aiming to capture the dynamics of wet active matter.",

While finite cell clusters are known to collectively migrate in response to external gradients, the competing effect of possible endogenous cues is largely unknown.Here, we demonstrate that the polarization of peripheral cells that pull the cluster's edge outward is sufficient to induce and sustain the collective migration of confluent clusters. We use a general continuum model to show that the underlying shape-sensing mechanism is purely mechanical, relying on long-range hydrodynamic interactions and cell-cell alignment forces. As a proof-of-concept, we validate our findings with experiments on monolayer clusters from various cell lines, where we control initial shapes and sizes. The mechanism operates independently of external signals and will generally interfere with them. Specifically, we predict and observe experimentally that it can override collective durotaxis, reversing the direction of migration. Together, our results offer a physical framework for understanding how cell interactions govern the interplay between global shape and collective motion and afford engineering principles for optimal control and manipulation of cell cluster shape and motion.",

We show that in such chemically active emulsions the interplay of chemical reactions, phase separation, and hydrodynamics effects complex self-organisation and pattern formation that can give rise to spatiotemporal chaos. This chaotic dynamics, unlike in classical turbulence, is not due to fluid inertia $-$ we analyse the system in the Stokes flow regime $-$ and it is different from the $\\textit{turbulence}$ of active nematics at low Reynolds number, for our fluid mixtures lack any orientational order. To explore the generic features of nonlinear dynamics in our system, we derive amplitude equations which we find to be identical to those obtained for Rayleigh-Benard convection with mean flow and stress-free conditions at the top and bottom plates. Chemically active emulsions possessing no internal order, we thus establish, can exhibit chaoticity that is driven by interfacial stresses in the fluid mixture.",

      "abstract": "Experimental evidence has shown the stability of oxygen-stress-damaged guanine, known as 8-oxoguanine. This common oxygen-damaged nucleobase is often found in the presence of reactive oxygen species and can result in the mispairing between adenine and 8-oxoguanine in a Hoogsteen pair. We have computationally investigated the role of 8-oxoguanine to support experimental results and focus the investigation towards the polymerase structure, identifying how 8-oxoguanine interacts in the polymerase environment. Quantum mechanical investigations show the Hoogsteen pairing of adenine and 8-oxoguanine is the most energetically favourable state compared to a Watson-Crick state, supporting experimental evidence. Molecular Dynamical calculation of 8-oxoguanine located in B-DNA provide an average C1' backbone spacing of 1.1 nm compared to adenine-thymine spacing of 1.05 nm but remains within the error margin, however when in the polymerase environment, 8-oxoguanine and the canonical adenine - thymine spacing match at 1.11-1.12nm spacing while 8-oxoguanine is located on the template strand, but is disrupted by tyrosine 251 while situated on the triphosphate strand. We observe that 8-oxoguanine, when paired with adenine in polymerase {\\lambda}, can mimic the adenine-thymine structure, as predicted in experimental results, and thus would be misincorporated, but is strongly dependent on its conformation.",

      "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.",

      "abstract": "Photosynthesis relies on efficient energy relaxation within the excited-state manifold of pigment-protein complexes. Since the protein scaffold is rather flexible, the resulting energetic and structural disorder gives rise to a complex excited-state energy level structure that fluctuates on all time scales. Although the impact of such fluctuations on relaxation processes is known, the precise exciton states involved in relaxation as well as the nature of the vibrational modes driving relaxation are under debate. Here single pigment-protein complexes from a photosynthetic purple bacterium are excited with two identical ultrashort phase-locked pulses producing two exciton wave packets that can interfere. This leads to a modulation of the emission intensity as a function of the delay time between the pulses that fades out within about 100 fs due to fluctuating environments on those time scales. For several single complexes we find variations of the interference patterns on time scale of several 10 s that reveal fluctuations in the energy relaxation pathways towards the lowest-energy exciton states. This relaxation is driven by temporal variations in the coupling between electronic excitations and low-frequency vibrational modes.",

Our results demonstrate that hindered diffusion near the wall can increase the median FPT by orders of magnitude compared to \"dry\" agents, while the intricate interplay of active motion and hydrodynamic attraction speeds up the arrival at large P\\'eclet numbers (measuring the importance of self-propulsion relative to diffusion). Strikingly, it leads to a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the dipole strength, where pushers reach the wall significantly faster than pullers. The latter become slower at an intermediate dipole strength and are more sensitive to their initial orientation, displaying a highly anisotropic behavior.",

We chose the lipids such that the bacteria have no adhereing interaction with the membrane. The tubes are generated by the pushing force exerted by the bacteria on the membrane of the vesicles. Once generated, the bacteria are confined within the tubes, resulting in long-lived tubes that protrude into the vesicle. We show that such tubes interact to form stable bound pairs that orbit each other. We speculate that the tubes are maintained by the persistent pushing force generated by the bacterium, and the rotating pairs are stabilized by a combination of curvature mediated interaction and vorticity generated in the membrane by the rotation of the flagella.",

Coarse-grained machine learning models offer a promising avenue for accelerating sampling, yet conventional force matching approaches often fail to capture the full thermodynamic landscape as fitting a model on the gradient may not fit the absolute differences between low-energy conformational states. In this work, we incorporate a complementary energy matching term into the loss function. We evaluate our framework on the Chignolin protein using the CGSchNet model, systematically varying the weight of the energy loss term. While energy matching did not yield statistically significant improvements in accuracy, it revealed distinct tendencies in how models generalize the free energy surface. Our results suggest future opportunities to enhance coarse-grained modeling through improved energy estimation techniques and multi-modal loss formulations.",

We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.",

      "abstract": "The dynamics of active viscoelastic surfaces plays an important role in biological systems. One prominent example is the actin cortex, a thin bio-polymer sheet underneath the outer membrane of biological cells which combines active molecular force generation with viscoelastic behavior characterized by elastic properties at short timescales and viscous properties at longer timescales. We consider a surface Maxwell model within dominant rheology and an additional active term to model the dynamics of the actin cortex. This captures both, shear and dilational surface dynamics. We propose a monolithic numerical approach based on the surface finite element method (SFEM), validate the results for special cases and experimentally demonstrate convergence properties. Moreover, imposing a ring-shaped region of an enhanced active stress mimicking the contractile ring during cytokinesis, we observe different types of emergent patterns and shape dynamics depending on the viscoelastic properties. While viscous surfaces show a ring, which slips to one side of the surface, viscoelasticity provides a stabilization mechanism of the ring, thus forming a requirement for subsequent cell division. This study provides an example that viscoelastic properties are key ingredients to understand biological materials.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Magnetization transfer (MT) has been identified as the principal source of $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature. This study assesses the sensitivity of established $T_1$ mapping techniques to variations in the underlying MT parameters. Methods: For each $T_1$-mapping method, the observed $T_1$ was simulated as a function of the underlying MT parameters $p_i^\\text{MT}$, corresponding to different brain regions of interest (ROIs) at 3T. As measures of sensitivity, the derivatives $\\partial T_1^\\text{observed} / \\partial p_i^\\text{MT}$ were computed and analyzed with a linear mixed-effects model as a function of $p_i^\\text{MT}$, ROI, pulse sequence type (e.g., inversion recovery, variable flip angle), and the individual sequences. Results: The analyzed $T_1$-mapping sequences have a considerable sensitivity to changes in the semi-solid spin pool size $m_0^\\text{s}$, $T_1^\\text{f}$ of the free, $T_1^\\text{s}$ of the semi-solid spin pool, and the (inverse) exchange rate $T_\\text{x}$. All derivatives vary considerably with the underlying MT parameters and between pulse sequences. The derivatives can, in general, not be determined by the sequence type, but rather depend on implementation details of the sequence. One notable exception is that variable-flip-angle methods are, in general, more sensitive to the exchange rate than inversion-recovery methods. Conclusion: Variations in $T_1$ measurements can be caused by several underlying MT parameters, and the sensitivity to each parameter depends on both the underlying MT parameters and the sequence.",

Dr. Martin will work with Dr.  Shigefume Okada, professor in the Faculty of Engineering, on  a research project entitled, \"Measurement of the Internal  Magnetic Fields on the FIX Experiment.\"    The proposed research will examine the various problems  involved in the development of controlled fusion as an  energy source.  The central challenge is to use magnetic  fields to confine a hot plasma long enough to produce a  sustained thermo-nuclear reaction.  One of the most  promising avenues for accomplishing this is the Field  Reversed Configuration, or FRC, a innovative device that  makes the most efficient use of its magnetic field and is  the simplest cold fusion mechanism to build and maintain. To  better understand the FRC it is important to ascertain the  internal structure of the magnetic field that confines the  hot plasma.  The research will measure this magnetic field  in the FRC Injection Experiment (FIX) at Osaka University in  Japan, using an innovative technique called Localized  Faraday Rotation (LFR).  The results of the analysis will  provide insights into theoretical and applied research  questions relating to controlled fusion as a practical,  reliable, and clean energy source for the international  community.  ***",

      "abstract": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is through providing a sensitive, robust, room temperature operating magnetometer.  Magnetometers are among the most widely used instruments in a variety of applications including healthcare, transportation safety, food contamination monitoring, and homeland security. In fact, the growing need for magnetic field sensors manifests itself in the $1.6 billion global market with a fast-growing medical segment. As for today, the maximum sensitivity is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. The high sensitivity is critically important for medical applications.  However, this high sensitivity can be achieved in the superconducting devices only at cryogenic temperatures.  The proposed magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer combines high sensitivity with room temperature operation. This combination provides a great improvement in healthcare by reducing the cost of equipment, in transportation safety enhancement by providing more accurate traffic control, and in food safety monitoring by detecting small concentrations of heavy metals.  It will be of great benefit to society to have a magnetometer combining the high sensitivity of superconducting devices and room temperature operation.    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for sensitive and room temperature operating magnetic field sensors by providing a magnetometer based on spin wave interferometer.  There are different types of magnetic sensors available on the market. As of today, the maximum sensitivity up to attoTesla is provided by the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. However, this high sensitivity can be achieved only at cryogenic temperatures. The latter makes superconducting magnetometers expensive and limits its practical application. The proposed magnetometer is based on spin wave interference and free of constraints inherent in superconducting devices. The research objectives encompass the development and demonstration of a compact, non-expensive magnetometer with up to attoTesla sensitivity operating in a temperature range from cryogenic to 560 K.  The outcomes of the proposed research will have an impact on commercial, defense and homeland security applications that need increasingly precise and robust magnetic sensors. The development of compact and high-sensitive magnetometer will be relevant to bio-sensing and bio-medical applications as well.    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
